#' Creates a character matrix which specifies which effects to estimate and
#' which effects to constrain to a non-zero value
#'
#' @param effects  A data frame that contains information on which cross-lagged effects to
#'                estimate or constrain to a value other than zero. Each row
#'                represents one effect. The `effects` object  must have four
#'                columns: column 1 has the variable names for the predictors,
#'                column 2 has the variable names for the outcomes, column
#'                3 has the names of the estimated effect or the value an unestimated
#'                effect should be constrained to, and column 4 has information
#'                on whether the effect should be estimated. This table can be
#'                created by using the `effectTable` function
#'
#' @param use     A vector with the variable names that will be used in the
#'                stability-informed model
#'
#' @return        A character matrix
#' @keywords internal
